                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-5">I am a self-professed skeptic and former Atheist turned Christian. As an Atheist I was attending church services only to support my wife, believing much of what I heard was simply a made-up story. However, I came to realize my belief was apathetic, based only on anecdotal evidence and opinions. So, I began a journey, “A Skeptics Journey”, to investigate the evidence for myself.<div><br></div><div>I began with the simple question “does God exist?”. Afterall, if God doesn’t exist there is no point looking at specific religions like Christianity. The evidence I found, including recent scientific discoveries, pointed strongly to a creator, which one could call “God”.</div><div><br></div><div>After concluding it was a reasonable conclusion that a God exists, my investigative journey turned to the truthfulness of Christianity and other major religions. The evidence I found for Christianity convinced me it was a truthful story and many of the arguments I had against the bible were in fact arguments for its truthfulness. The other major religions did not fare as well when I looked closely at their history, leaders, writings and teachings.</div></h3>
